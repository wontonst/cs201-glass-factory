Here are a few things I discovered that we need to unify.

Universal glass object. Current setup is
Glass extends UniqueObject (for an ID) and has a Barcode (for a categorization)

Debug message control. This is what I expect everyone can do when we integrate (in fact everyone should extend glassline.interfaces.PrintControllable
myConveyorFamily.setDebug(true);//this enables printing
Debug messages should follow the format
MyConveyorFamily: mymessage
MyConveyorFamily.MySubclass: mymessage
